Task B  client-b .txt:

# set variable j to 1
j = 1

#while j is less than or equal to 10
while j <=10:
      #print j
       print (j)
       #increment j by 1
       j +=1
explanination:
* A while loop is used to print the value of j from 1 to 10.
* the loop continues as long as j is less then or equal 1 to 10
* the variable j is incremented by 1 in each iteration
